Libraries are pre-configured devices, Areas, and even small grids that can be reused in different simulations.

The List of libraries is paginated. 
You can either click through the pages by pressing the "Prev" or "Next" button on the bottom right corner or use the search field on the top right to filter the list by the library names.
