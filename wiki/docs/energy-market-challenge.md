The commitment made to the energy transition by an increasing number of governments resulted in numerous incentive schemes, spurring growth in renewable power capacity in the [European Union](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300951) and [globally](https://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gsr_2019_full_report_en.pdf). In 2019, the production of wind and solar energy was higher than energy produced with coal [in Germany for the first time](https://www.energy-charts.de/energy.htm?source=all-sources&period=annual&year=all). This positive trend, however, also created a challenge in that [the installed capacity of renewable energy outgrew the capacity of the distribution grid](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Integration+of+Distributed+Generation+in+the+Power+System-p-9780470643372), impeding the grid operators to [effectively transmit the energy to the final consumer](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/EG3%20Refined%20Recommendations_FINAL_clean.pdf). As a result, they have called for innovative tools to enable, [â€œmarket-based activation of explicit flexibilities that are able to alter power flows"](https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2019/04/16/a-toolbox-for-tsos-and-dsos-to-make-use-of-new-system-and-grid-services/). Energy asset owners, from individual households to communities, could also use such tools for more optimal energy consumption, while contributing to wider market flexibility. If equipped with a decision-making agency, the distributed energy resources would become [the medium to solve the challenge](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/a-case-for-flexibility-markets-enabled-by-local-peer-to-peer-exchanges-43300b625cb5) they have inadvertently created, while further enhancing the system's sustainability.

A bottom-up, community energy model could transform our energy system to be more democratic, sustainable and stable. The European Union has recently laid [the legal foundations](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/energy-communities-a-game-changer-for-the-european-electricity-grid-fd588a3063b0) for this reconstruction and [other regulators](https://www.ferc.gov/media/ferc-order-no-2222-fact-sheet) are also supporting this market transformation.
