This is the user's manual to the D3A User Interface (UI) at [d3a.io](http://d3a.io/).

For questions, comments, and feedback, please engage with us through the D3A community at [gitter.im/D3A-community](https://gitter.im/D3A-community/welcome).

We are always welcoming feedback regarding how to improve the D3A.

We are starting a tutorial video series. Check out our first video here and let us know what other videos you'd like to see!

In the D3A UI users can model, simulate, optimize, and (coming soon) download and deploy their own energy exchange. Each exchange will be downloadable as a set of smart contracts, allowing the exchange to be decentralized for specific use cases.

When creating, configuring and running a simulation of an energy trading use-case, the D3A UI will lead the user to three pages:

- [Projects (Home Page)](projects-home-page.md)
- [Simulation Configuration](simulation-configuration.md)
- [Results](results.md)
