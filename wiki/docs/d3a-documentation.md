This is the documentation of the D3A (Decentralized Autonomous Area Agent) which is being developed by Grid Singularity as an interface and codebase to model, simulate, optimize and (coming soon) download and deploy a custom energy exchange. 

The documentation is divided into three parts:

- [User Interface (d3a.io)](user-interface-d3a.md) which concerns the usage and behavior of the browser app at [d3a.io](http://d3a.io/) (front-end)
- [Backend Codebase](backend-codebase.md) which is the master wiki for the open source backend code that can be downloaded here: https://github.com/gridsingularity/d3a 
- [FAQ](faq.md) for commonly asked questions
