The Grid Singularity Energy Exchange Engine (D3A) is developed by [Grid Singularity](https://gridsingularity.com/) as an interface ([d3a.io](https://www.d3a.io/)) and [open source codebase](gridsingularity/d3a: decentralised autonomous area agent) (see Licensing) to model, simulate, optimize and (coming soon) download and deploy interconnected, grid-aware energy marketplaces.

Grid Singularity has been proclaimed [the World Tech Pioneer by the World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/grid-singularity-gmbh-gsy-gmbh) and is also known as a co-founder of [the Energy Web Foundation](https://www.energyweb.org/) that gathers leading energy corporations globally co-developing a shared blockchain-based platform. Our team is guided by the following principles:

Grid Singularity facilitates a bottom-up market design by connecting aggregators, which in turn connect households and distributed energy assets digitally represented by trading agents, and grid operators through an application interface ([Grid Operator API](grid-operator-api.md) and [Asset API](assets-api.md)).

The [backend code](https://github.com/gridsingularity/d3a) offers the full functionality of the active version of the D3A, while the user friendly [User Interface](https://www.d3a.io/) (UI) offers eased access to the majority of features found in the backend. New features are typically developed in the backend first and are made available in the UI after internal testing for usability and accuracy. 

Our software empowers energy communities. An energy community is a grouping of multiple energy actors: consumers, producers and prosumers (consumers who also produce energy) with the goal to exchange energy locally to improve economic, social and environmental welfare. The European Union defines these communities as citizen energy communities or renewable energy communities (see _[Energy Communities: a Game Changer for the European Electricity Grid](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/energy-communities-a-game-changer-for-the-european-electricity-grid-fd588a3063b0)_, 2020) and they are also known as energy cooperatives, microgrids, self-consumption communities or community choice aggregators (CCAs) in different markets.

Modelling simulation studies carried out by Grid Singularity and German and [Dutch](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/an-energy-exchange-engine-for-local-energy-marketplaces-28d5be23705e) energy communities and utilities using real-world data have revealed that the use of Grid Singularity’s Energy Exchange Engine can increase community self-sufficiency and self-consumption by [7.7% and 5.7%, respectively, and reduce energy bills by around 21%](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/modelling-study-to-assess-the-potential-benefits-of-trading-in-and-between-local-energy-d721395ddd4b ), which could be reinvested in additional storage or other distributed energy assets (DERs).

Utilization of Grid Singularity’s exchange engine by a grid operator could [reduce peak loading and congestion by purchasing grid balancing services and levying flexible grid fees](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/energy-singularity-challenge-2020-testing-novel-grid-fee-models-and-intelligent-peer-to-peer-6a0d715a9063). The initial simulation experiments undertaken by Grid Singularity and German and Dutch energy grid operators revealed 10% reductions in peak loading and congestion, expected to improve with innovation in trading algorithms and grid tariff models.

Importantly, Grid Singularity’s energy exchange engine furnishes both prosumers and regular consumers with equitable access to energy trading. Simulations studies, undertaken by using real data from a German energy community EWS Schönau, showed that activating local peer-to-peer trading benefits not just a community endowed in distributed resources but also a neighbouring community devoid of such resources:

To efficiently manage energy within a community while preserving end-user freedom and decentralization, [a local energy market (LEM) enabling peer-to-peer and community trading](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/analysis-of-local-electricity-markets-as-a-platform-to-modernise-consumer-and-grid-interaction-3fff63ef74e7) can be established. Grid Singularity’s simulation tool available at d3a.io can be used to configure a grid-aware LEM, leading to future physical deployment. The user can build a “digital twin” representation of physical energy systems and energy markets (using real-world data) and run complex simulations in order to assess the impact of different actions or assets in the system.
