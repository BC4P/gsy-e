This feature is currently only available in our previous interface (d3a.io) and it will soon be available in the new interface, when this documentation will be updated.

Users have the ability to modify the modelling setup while the simulated network is running. These modifications are termed **events**. To create an event the user can either go to the ''Modelling'' page and make a change while the simulation is running or pause the simulation beforehand (by clicking pause on the Results page), resuming once changes are implemented.


Possible events are :

*   **Add** or **delete** markets and energy assets
*   **Change parameters** of energy assets (with the exception of their names and the Market Maker)
*   **Change market configuration** settings (except names)

##Events in Simulations run using the User Interface

This feature is currently only available for simulations using the backend code and it will soon be available in the new interface, when this documentation will be updated. For backend modelling instructions please see [this section](backend_events.md).
