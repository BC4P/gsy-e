In the two-sided market, buyers are able to place bids in the market, alongside the offers placed by sellers (as seen in the one-sided market).

The market collects offers and bids and serves the functionality of accepting and deleting offers and bids as well as dispatching these offer and bids to other markets via the [Inter-Area Agent](inter-area-agent.md). 

The auction is continuous, meaning that once an offer or bid is posted, it can be matched right away, even before the end of the slot market.

An [Inter-Area Agent (IAA)](inter-area-agent.md) is created and operated by each area to deal with forwarding offers and bids to the connected markets. The area is constantly triggers the matching between bids and offers according to the matching algorithm.
