On this page the user can set up the architecture of the grid by adding Areas and Devices. **Warning: each simulation is limited to 50 agents.** Each area or device is considered as 1 agent.

[Areas](areas.md) are made up of a spot market in which all connected devices, sub-areas and parent areas trade energy. Areas can potentially house multiple markets of different market types. This feature will be available in the future.



After creating the first area the user has to define a [Market Maker](market-maker.md).


There are 4 different types of basic Devices available (for detailed settings descriptions follow the individual links):

- [PV](pv.md)
- [Storage](storage.md)
- [Load](load.md)
- [Power Plant](power-plant.md)

The user can also insert [Libraries](libraries.md), which are customized devices available from the D3A community. A list of these devices with a search function appears when clicking on "LIBRARY" on the upper right corner.
