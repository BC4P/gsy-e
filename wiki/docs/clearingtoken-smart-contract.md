The ClearingToken smart contract is responsible for keeping and updating the token balance for every user of the blockchain. The idea behind this contract is that every market that wants to perform energy trading needs to be approved first by a central authority. There are 2 main non-view functions that this smart contract exposes: 

- `globallyApprove()` : Is used for approving one clearing member (market). This needs to be executed before a market starts trading, otherwise the trade function of the Market smart contract will always fail. A subsequent event will be emitted (`ApproveClearingMember` event) which will notify the listeners of this contract about the market being approved.
- `clearingTransfer()`: Is used for transferring tokens from the buyer to the seller, keeping and updating the token balance amongst all simulation participants. Validates that the market that called this function is an approved clearing member, and if yes, performs the token exchange, if not nothing happens and the caller gets notified about the failed token transfer.
