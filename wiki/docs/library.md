Libraries contain preconfigured energy assets, markets, and even small grids that can be reused in different simulations (e.g. loads, PVs, houses and even entire communities).

The list of libraries is paginated. You can either click through the pages by pressing the "Prev" or "Next" button in the bottom right corner or use the search field in the top right corner to filter the list by the library names.
