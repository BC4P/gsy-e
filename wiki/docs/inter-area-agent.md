The Inter-Area Agent (IAA) plays a crucial role in the communication architecture of Grid Singularityâ€™s exchange engine (D3A), allowing different markets in the hierarchy to interact and trade with each other. IAA is created for each market (households/buildings, streets, etc. that do not have preset trading strategies) and mainly deals with forwarding bids and offers  markets of different hierarchy levels. 

The following illustration shows a sample grid setup and the role of the IAA in the market hierarchy during one time slot:

The IAA is responsible for modelling hierarchical market operations, as follows:

*   **Forwarding** bids and offers from a lower hierarchy (market) to an upper hierarchy.
*   **Reacting** to bids, offers and trades reported by IAAs in connected markets, in order to propagate the event for an offer/bid that has been forwarded from this IAA.
*   Triggering the **matching** of bids and offers for the two-sided market.

To prioritize local trades, IAAs forward bids and offers to higher/lower markets with a **two-tick delay**.
