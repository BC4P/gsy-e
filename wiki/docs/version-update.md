## How to update the D3A and API Client

The D3A is often updated with new features. These steps allow you to update to the most current version

### Update the D3A

Open a terminal and activate the d3a virtual environment as described in the Installation Instructions for your OS. Then type:

```
git pull origin/master
fab sync
```

If fab sync does not work on your machine, please try:

The D3A should now be up to date.

### Update the API Client
